           <p>Fact: Your wedding day will be the result of approximately 10,000 small decisions, each which you may or may not have ruminated over for what society might consider “too long.” What first dance song?
           Tall centerpieces or low ones? One big cake or lots of small desserts?
           The wedding planning questions and decisions may seem endless (and if you're planning a wedding during the coronavirus pandemic, even more endless), but truly, some are much bigger than others.
           In fact, the answers to some questions to ask yourself during the wedding planning process can have huge impact the overall outcome of your big day—whereas other decisions,
           like what color linens you choose, really won’t matter much in the long run (trust me!).
           But don’t fret—while these decisions may seem big, they’re not hard—all you need to do to figure them out is be prepared and have some vision. Here’s a primer on exactly which common wedding planning questions you need to ask yourself before stepping on the gas. </p>
